The SMaHT Network maintains policies that guide the organization's operation, which all Network members are expected to follow, including associate members.  These policies are drafted and developed by the [SMaHT Policy Working Group](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXjrcOaNwjk99H_oPyrzLtj1ErHeb7_7/view?usp=drive_link) and approved by the SMaHT Network members. The SMaHT Policy Working Group reviews approved policies annually and makes any necessary updates.

The following are links to the current list of approved policies.
